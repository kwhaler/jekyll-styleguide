# Jekyll Styleguide

A styleguide is a resource for designers, product managers, and developers, providing a common language around UI patterns. Use it to maintain modular front-end code and visual consistency across the web app. This one is made with Jekyll. Add Foundation or Bootstrap and rock it!

This is a boilerplate styleguide made with Jekyll - no additional styling to get in your way.

It contains code for making swatches as well as starting points for:

- colors
- typography
- tables
- lists
- forms

Grab a copy and extend as you need.
